I did note the line in the brief stating that you pay a lot of attention to producing thread safe code.
This isn't a concept I am particularly familiar with and I didn't have time to read up properly on the subject. I have
made sure I declared all my variables within methods in the controller and service, but I'm not sure if this is
sufficient to ensure thread safety.
